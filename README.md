CS 225 Final Project code


To build the code for this project you will need to first download OCaml and Opam for your system. The downloads and guides can be found here at OCamlâ€™s main site: https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html . Once OCaml is installed on your computer, download the repository to a convenient spot on your computer. Once the repository is downloaded on your computer open the repository up in a terminal to the root of the repository. Then run make final on the directory.

To read the proposal download and install a LaTeX on your machine and parse the code either through an IDE or use the same method used for the OCaml, make proposal.
