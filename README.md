CS 225 Final Project code

This project is for David Darias’ CS 225 class. This project is being worked on by Connor Allan and Aaron Longchamp as their final project. For this project going to be implementing a semantics for System F extended with error types (error, try, raise exception and handle exception). 

To build the code for this project you will need to first download OCaml and Opam for your system. The downloads and guides can be found here at OCaml’s main site: https://ocaml.org/docs/install.html . Once OCaml is installed on your computer, download the repository to a convenient spot on your computer. Once the repository is downloaded on your computer open the repository up in a terminal to the root of the repository. Then run make final on the directory.

To read the proposal download and install a LaTeX on your machine and parse the code either through an IDE or use the same method used for the OCaml, make proposal.

Challenges run into:
1. Figuring out how to deal with type expressions
2. Type cases for testing
